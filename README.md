# emiCalculator
This is a EMI Calculator application built using ReactJs, Hooks and Redux. This is the very basic Redux application specially for beginners like me. I hope this will be helpful for many beginners.

I have implemented <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">Highchart</a> for this application.

### Installation
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the folder
- Run npm install
- Run npm start

Please feel free to improvise my code. I am just beginner to the ReactJs world :)
