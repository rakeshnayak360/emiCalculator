# emiCalculator
This is a EMI Calculator application built using ReactJs, Hooks and Redux. This is the very basic React application specially for beginners like me. I hope this will be helpful for many beginners. I have refered many tutorials/free courses for this implementation.

I have implemented <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">Highchart</a> for this application.

### Installation
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the folder
- Run npm install
- Run npm start

As you can see, this is not very well written code. I did this application just to understand Redux concept. Please feel free to improvise my code. I am just beginner to the ReactJs world :)
